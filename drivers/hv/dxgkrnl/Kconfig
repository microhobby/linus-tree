config DXGKRNL
	tristate "Microsoft Paravirtualized GPU support"
	depends on HYPERV
	help
	  This driver supports paravirtualized virtual GPU devices, exposed by
	  Microsoft Hyper-V when Linux is running inside of a virtual machine
	  hosted by Windows. The virtual machines needs to be configured to use
	  host GPU adapters. The driver name is dxgkrnl.

	  An example of such virtual machine is a  Windows Subsystem for
	  Linux container. When such container is instantiated, the Windows host
	  assigns compatible host GPU adapters to the container. The corresponding
	  virtual GPU devices appear on the PCI bus in the container. These
	  devices are enumerated and accessed by this driver.

	  Communications with the driver are done by using the Microsoft libdxcore
	  library, which translates the D3DKMT interface
	  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/>
	  to the driver IOCTLs. The virtual GPU devices are paravirtualized,
	  which means that access to the hardware is done in the host. The driver
	  communicates with the host using Hyper-V VM bus communication channels.

config DXGKRNL_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debug checks for Microsoft Paravirtualized GPU driver"
	depends on DXGKRNL
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the Microsoft Paravirtualized GPU driver to
	  perform additional checks and provide more debug information.
